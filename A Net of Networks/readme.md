### Neural Networks Exploration
This project delves into the fundamentals of Neural Networks, focusing on how model performance evolves through iterative training. Youâ€™ll explore how adjusting weights and increasing the number of training cycles (epochs) can minimize error and enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of a neural network model.
