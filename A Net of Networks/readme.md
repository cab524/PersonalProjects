### A Net of Networks
This project delves into the fundamentals of Neural Networks, focusing on how model performance evolves through iterative training. Youâ€™ll explore how adjusting weights and increasing the number of training cycles (epochs) can minimize error and enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of a neural network model.

Note: This project is currently in progress and is not finished.
